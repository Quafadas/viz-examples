# Plotting stuff in scala

This repository is a record and example of a couple of years of on-off thinking about plotting stuff in scala. 

There are also other ways to plot stuff in scala, but maybe it's educational, to follow this journey. 

cs launch --fork almond:0.13.1 --scala 3.1.0 --force -- --install

1. [Example 1](src/Example_1.ipynb) - vega and jupyter
2. [Example 2](src/Example_2.ipynb) - it's just JSON!
3. [Example 3](main/scala/Example_3.scala) - other plot targets
4. [Example 4](Example_4.ipynb) - Using abstractions
5. [Example 5](Example_5.ipynb) - Typesafe plotting?
